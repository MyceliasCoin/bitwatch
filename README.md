Enable cyber forensics on the Bitcoin blockchain by linking accounts used by the same individual and/or entity.

Results can inform criminal investigations into money flows for dark webs (i.e., Silk Road) and fraud detection by tracing network transaction patterns.

Solution is highly transferable to other public blockchains (i.e., Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Litcoin).
